# Week01 UNIX

### [Assignment 0](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/fall_2019/blob/master/assignments/assignment_0.md) is due at the beginning of this lecture

## [Lecture 01 Slides](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/fall_2019/blob/master/lectures/Lecture01_WelcomeToTheMatrix.pdf)

## Computer Preparation
* Win10
  * Log into your Ubuntu terminal.  _We will not use `gitbash` unless you can't get Ubuntu running._ You are in your home directory. If the Ubuntu app is not installed, then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings/blob/master/InstallLinuxOnWindows_Automated.pdf)
  * If you are using an Ubuntu terminal that hasn't been setup (you'll know because it will ask you to create a new user name and password) or you notice odd cursor behavior when editing text in the terminal, then run the following code:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings.git
    . ./wlsUBUNTU_settings/updateSettings.bash
    rm -rf wlsUBUNTU_settings
    ```
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```
* MacOS
  * Open a terminal window
  * Consider installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  You will be able to use homebrew to install linux software, such as `tree`, which is used in the slide show.
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```

## Text Book Vs. Lecture Slides
The [**Lecture_02 Slides**](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/fall_2019/blob/master/lectures/Lecture02_WelcomeToTheMatrix.pdf) closely follow the book but there is some additional information that is not provided in the book (and vice versa). In the lecture slides, the `code blocks` are represented by green text on a black background, mimicking the terminal.

## IN CLASS EXERCISES

* There were no in class exercises this week. CSB Mind Expanders 01.01 & 01.02 were completed prior to class in [Assignment_0](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/fall_2019/blob/master/assignments/assignment_0.md)

## HOMEWORK
* [Assignment_1, Due 09/13](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/fall_2019/blob/master/assignments/assignment_1.md)
