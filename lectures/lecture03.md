## Lecture 02 Slides

## Computer Preparation
* Win10
  * Log into your Ubuntu terminal.  _We will not use `gitbash` unless you can't get Ubuntu running._ You are in your home directory. If the Ubuntu app is not installed, then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings/blob/master/InstallLinuxOnWindows_Automated.pdf)
  * If you are using an Ubuntu terminal that hasn't been setup (you'll know because it will ask you to create a new user name and password) or you notice odd cursor behavior when editing text in the terminal, then run the following code:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings.git
    . ./wlsUBUNTU_settings/updateSettings.bash
    rm -rf wlsUBUNTU_settings
    ```
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```
* MacOS
  * Open a terminal window
  * Consider installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  You will be able to use homebrew to install linux software, such as `tree`, which is used in the slide show.
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```

Complete the exercise(s) by answering the question(s) in the online form and submitting.  You must be logged into your TAMUCC email account to have your identity attached to your answers. 

You may work in groups, but each person must fill out the online answer form.

The exercises in the online forms closely follow those in the book.  I do make minor modifications and provide tips in the online form.  To ensure that your work is saved, **_I highly recommend that you first record your answers in a text document in either Notepad++ or BBedit and save them to your computer_**.  For an excellently formatted example, see the solutions provided by the book in `CSB/unix/solutions`.
