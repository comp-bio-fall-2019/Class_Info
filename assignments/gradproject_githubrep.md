Create a GitHub repository for your class project with a readme.  Include your plan either in the readme or as a separate document.

I am not 100% sure if you can make this in tamucc-comp-bio, but if you can I recommend it because we can make it private.  Let me know if you cannot an I'll see what we can do.

To submit, invite me, cbird808, as a member of your repo
