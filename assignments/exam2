# [Exam 2](https://classroom.github.com/a/VSNTwKf2)

## Due 11/08

## Computer Preparation
* Win10
  * Log into your Ubuntu terminal.  _We will not use `gitbash` unless you can't get Ubuntu running._ You are in your home directory.

  * If the Ubuntu app is not installed or you are using an Ubuntu terminal that hasn't been setup (you'll know because it will ask you to create a new user name and password), then follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/cbirdlab/wlsUBUNTU_settings/blob/master/README.md) to set it up. Note that I have automated the process and you should be able to complete it in less than a minute.
  
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```

* MacOS

  * Open a terminal window

  * Consider installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  You will be able to use homebrew to install linux software, such as `tree`, which is used in the slide show.
  
  * If the `CSB` directory does not exist in your home directory (check with `ls`), then run the following code to clone the `CSB` repository into your home directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
    ```

## GitHub Preparation
* You must be a member of our class's github repository. If you are not a member (because you did not accept the initial invite) then please let me know and I'll reinvite you. 
* Make sure you are logged into github.

## Description of Exam 2
